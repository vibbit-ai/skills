# Adding Vibbit subtitles

Use this cloud path when Vibbit subtitles are specifically requested. Ordinary subtitles can be completed locally through [hybrid production](../../workflows/hybrid-video.md).

Public `MEDIA_PRODUCTION` examples include text/subtitle tracks; use [media composition](media-composition.md). Distinguish an existing timed transcript, a need for transcription, and dynamic subtitle styling.

## Correct, segment, and time captions

1. Fix the adopted media and script. Reuse its applicable transcript; otherwise request only [ASR](../analysis/speech-transcription.md). Preserve raw recognition and media identity; corrected captions are a derived output.
2. Compare actual speech with the script, checking omissions, repeats, names, numbers, units, and mixed languages. Correct ASR mistakes in captions. Actual spoken mistakes need audio repair or an explicit remaining issue; correct captions cannot hide wrong speech. Listen to uncertain passages, or mark them unverified.
3. Normalize display spelling, numbers, abbreviations, and punctuation without changing meaning. Keep displayed text separate from pronunciation and do not rewrite the adopted script to match recognition errors.
4. Break at short clauses, semantic groups, and actual pauses. Keep names, number-unit pairs, and fixed phrases together. Fit the frame, font, and reading speed, usually in one or two lines, instead of applying a universal character count.
5. Ordinary captions use real segment `from/to` values. Line wrapping within a caption keeps its time span. Splitting into sequential captions needs actual subsegment/word boundaries or boundaries established by listening. Without them, keep the original interval and wrap lines; never divide time by character count. Only word highlighting or word-triggered animation needs [word-level binding](../../creation/script-and-timing.md).
6. Composite through the selected production path and check readability, bounds, overlap, synchronization, and transitions. Text/style changes reuse speech and avatar footage and rerender only affected postproduction. New audio requires corresponding new timing.

Captions and B-roll share the actual timeline. Account for trims, speed changes, or inserted intervals; picture-only overlays can retain timing when soundtrack and temporal relationships are unchanged. Missing word timestamps must not block ordinary segment captions.

Vibbit dynamic subtitle templates are temporarily unavailable; do not submit their parameters. Continue ordinary captions through this page. Read [subtitle template boundaries](../../resources/subtitle-templates.md) when that specific style is requested.

If runnable composition configuration is missing, deliver text/timing and explain it has not been burned into the video. Do not claim complete automatic transcription and dynamic-styling integration.
