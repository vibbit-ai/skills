# Audio generation: generate_audio

Task type: `AI_GENERATE_AUDIO`. Mode: `async`; actual behavior and account access depend on the response.

[API reference](https://vibbit.apifox.cn/513300730e0)

Generate speech, BGM, sound effects or a combined audio track through text_prompt. Pass accessible audio URLs directly in reference_audio_urls, or use existing reference_material_ids. Preserve the script and verify the resulting audio; voice_id is not an input field.

## Inputs

Client fields and minimum requirements follow; the server may impose additional checks.

| Field | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text_prompt` | string | Yes |
| `format` | string | No |
| `sample_rate` | integer | No |
| `speech_rate` | integer | No |
| `loudness_rate` | integer | No |
| `pitch_rate` | integer | No |
| `max_duration_seconds` | integer | No |
| `reference_material_ids` | ids | No |
| `reference_audio_urls` | urls | No |
| `reference_image_urls` | urls | No |

Replace example URLs/IDs with real accessible assets and resources before submitting.

~~~json
{
  "text_prompt": "A natural English male voice says: \"Welcome to the show.\" Soft background music supports the voice, with one light chime at the end. Add no other speech.",
  "format": "mp3",
  "sample_rate": 48000
}
~~~

## Call

~~~bash
node "$VIBBIT_SKILL_DIR/scripts/vibbit.js" generate_audio --input /absolute/path/request.json --dry-run
node "$VIBBIT_SKILL_DIR/scripts/vibbit.js" generate_audio --input /absolute/path/request.json
~~~

The client uses `input_info.input = JSON.stringify(input)` inside the input_info object. Do not change encoding and automatically resubmit after an error.

## Voice, music, effects, and controls

Speech/narration, background music, effects, and ambience can be generated independently or together. A music example in the API docs does not restrict it to music. Combined audio does not imply separate stems.

- text_prompt: required, by default at most 3000 characters; include exact speech, sound design, reference roles, and timing.
- format: mp3 or wav; server default mp3.
- sample_rate: by default 16000, 24000, or 48000 Hz; server default 48000.
- speech_rate / loudness_rate: integer -50..100; server default 0.
- pitch_rate: integer -12..12; server default 0.
- max_duration_seconds: integer 1..120 by default; server default 120. This is an upper bound, not an exact output length.
- reference_audio_urls: HTTP(S) audio URLs accessible to the server and provider, including uploaded object_url values.
- reference_material_ids: real audio-library IDs belonging to the current tenant and workspace; preserve signed 64-bit precision with decimal strings.
- reference_image_urls: HTTP(S) image URLs, referenced with independent literal tokens such as `@图片1`.

Optional values are not automatically filled by the CLI. Omit unused reference arrays; supplied arrays must be nonempty. Describe voice gender, emotion, and delivery in text_prompt. No voice_id field is defined; an ID is not required for prompt-based speech.

## Audio reference requirements

After `upload_info --file`, put the actual `object_url` in `reference_audio_urls`. Existing accessible URLs can be reused directly; material-library registration and material_id are unnecessary. Replace the example URL with a real one:

~~~json
{
  "text_prompt": "Use the voice character of @音频1 to say: Welcome to our traditional pear syrup.",
  "reference_audio_urls": ["https://example.com/reference.mp3"],
  "format": "mp3",
  "sample_rate": 48000,
  "max_duration_seconds": 30
}
~~~

| Default constraint | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Count | At most 3 audio references after merging and deduplicating IDs and URLs |
| Per audio | 2–30 seconds; at most 15 MiB |
| Combined audio | At most 90 seconds and 45 MiB |
| Mixed inputs | Resolve IDs first, then URLs; number references in the deduplicated order |
| Prompt tokens | A single audio reference gets `@音频1` automatically; multiple references require explicit tokens within the final count |

For example, an ID resolves to audio A and the URL array contains A's URL followed by B's URL: `@音频1` refers to A and `@音频2` to B. Preserve these literal service tokens rather than translating them. Replacing, deleting, or reordering references requires corresponding prompt updates. Images have independent `@图片1` tokens and do not consume audio numbers.

The CLI checks URL syntax, ID types, and existing numeric ranges, then preserves arrays and prompt text. The server resolves materials, deduplicates across IDs and URLs, and validates final counts, tokens, reachability, duration, and size. Adding the two raw array lengths cannot determine the final audio count. A local path, object URL, or voice ID is not a library material ID. Prompt-only generation can proceed without references.

For voice-only, specify no music/effects; for music, specify whether vocals are wanted; for an effect, specify its source/action/duration. Do not add sounds merely to exercise the API.

Preserve task_id/journal, query to completion, and inspect the actual audio/metadata. Pass an accessible resulting audio_url directly to [digital-human video](digital_human_video.md); no download/reupload is needed.
